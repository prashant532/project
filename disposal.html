            <span class="byline"><br>Generally, waste could be liquid or solid waste. Both of them could be hazardous. Liquid and solid waste types can also be grouped into organic, re-usable and recyclable waste.

            <h2><b><br><br>Incineration method of waste management</b></h2>
            <p><br>This simply means burning waste. This method is common in countries with limited landfill space.
                Incineration chambers can be small for domestic use, but ther are large ones for municipal use as well.
                It is great for treating waste with contamination (like those from hospitals) and hazardous waste from
                factories, but the method produces too much carbon dioxide. Modern incineration processes are more
                efficient and release less dioxin than home fireplaces and backyard barbecues. This method is very
                common in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. This method is effective, but expensive.</p>

        <div class="tbox2">
            <h2><b><br><br>Sanitary Landfills as waste disposal</b></h2>
            <p><br>Generally, this term means a large piece of land away from living places where all the waste from a
                town is deposited. But there is more to landfills. Proper landfill management involves sorting out all
                the waste (waste separation), and sending only the waste that cannot be recycled and composted to the
                site. <br><br>Proper landfills, are also lined at the bottom to minimize the leakage of soil pollutants
                and other toxins from getting into the water table. This method is effective, but expensive and
                difficult.<br><br>In many towns, sorting is not done, and all the waste (paper, food, diapers, glass) is
                mixed up and deposited. That is a problem because, glass, and plastics take thousands of years to
                decompose. Additionally, the landfills soon become full, smelly and unsafe for the environment.<br><br>Proper
                waste management is not cheap, but it is something we all have to get involved and discuss it. The
                effect of not getting involved can be catastrophic to our health and environment.</p>
