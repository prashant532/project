## Statement of scope
Waste are items we (individuals, offices, schools, industries, hospitals) don’t need and discard.
Sometimes there are things we have that the law requires us to discard because they can be harmful.
Waste comes in infinite sizes—some can be as small as an old toothbrush, or as large as the body of a school bus.

Waste has been a major environmental issue everywhere since the industrial revolution.
Besides the waste we create at home, school and other public places, there are also those from hospitals, industries, farms and
other sources. Humans rely so much on material things and they all (almost) end up as waste. And hey — where does the waste end up?

Everyone creates waste, although some people are very environmentally conscious and create very little.
Likewise, some countries do a very good job creating less waste and managing the rest.
Others are pretty horrible and have created huge environmental problems for the people and animals living there.
