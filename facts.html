        <p><em>Europe creates about over 1.8 billion tonnes of waste each year. This means each person creates about
            3.5tonnes on average.<br></em></p>
        <p><em>In 2010, Americans generated about 250 million tons of trash and recycled and composted over 85 million
            tons of this material, equivalent to a 34.1 percent recycling rate (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). On average,
            we recycled and composted 1.51 pounds out of our individual waste generation of 4.43 pounds per person per
            day. —EPA, USA.<br><br></em></p>

        <p><b>What is the difference between trash and garbage?</b><br>
            <em>Solid waste form places like your atic, backyard or study. Trash items include paper and card boxes and
                the like.<br>
                This is waste from kitchen and bathroom. They also include waste from cooking food and from food storage
                facilities. <br><br></em></p>


        <p><em>The average family in the UK throws away around 40kg of recyclable plastic each year, this figure is
            rising and it’s totally preventable. The next time you bin something plastic spare a thought and have a
            little ponder. Could that plastic be recycled and used again?<br><br></em></p>

        <p>
            <em>Your home uses around 500 glass bottles per year. All those ketchup bottles, jars of sauces and
                condiment containers are washed and reused. Some are broken down and made into other glass products.<br><br></em>
        </p>


        <p><em>We get through an astonishing 15 million plastic bottles per day in the UK and any one of these bottles
            can take up to 500 years to decompose properly. Recycling resolves this issue and plastic can be reused time
            and time again.<br><br></em></p>
        <p><em>Chop down 24 trees and you have enough raw materials to create a ton of newspapers. Think about that the
            next time you read a tabloid or pick up a broadsheet in the morning.<br></em></p>

        <p>
            <em>One solitary recycled glass bottle could power a laptop for 25 minutes.<br>
                <br></em></p>


        <p>
            <em>Half of your weekly food waste could easily be composted and used as nutrient for garden borders.<br>
                <br></em></p>


        <p>
            <em>Over half of the waste found in standard household waste bins could be recycled and reused again.
                Consider that when you are throwing something in the non-recycling bin at home, are you sure the item
                you are tossing away is going in the right place?<br>
                <br></em></p>
