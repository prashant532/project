                <p style="color:Grey; width:80%; margin:auto;">Medical/clinical waste, normally refers to waste produced
                    from health care facilities, such as hospitals, clinics, surgical theaters, veterinary hospitals and
                    labs. They tend to be classified as hazard waste rather than general waste.<br><br>Items in this

                    and syringes.<br><br></p>

                <p style="color:white; width:80%; margin:auto;">Typically, this is waste generated by agricultural
                    activities. These include horticulture, fruit growing, seed growing, livestock breeding, market
                    gardens and seedling nurseries.<br><br>Waste items in this group include empty pesticide containers,

                <p style="color:white; width:80%; margin:auto;">Since the industrial revolution, the rise in the number
                    of industries manufacturing glass, leather, textile, food, electronics, plastic and metal products
                    has significantly contributed to waste production. Take a look at the things in your home, every
                    item there was probably manufactured and possibly, waste was produced as a result.<br><br></p>

                <p style="color:white; width:80%; margin:auto;">Construction waste is that resulting from the
                    construction of roads and building. Sometimes old buildings and structures are pulled down
                    (demolished) to make space for new ones. This is particularly common in old cities that are
                    modernizing. This is called demolition waste.<br><br>Waste items include concrete debris, wood,
                    earth, huge package boxes and plastics from the building materials and the like.<br><br></p>

                <p style="color:white; width:80%; margin:auto;">This is waste from electronic and electrical devices.
                    Think of DVD and music players, TV, Telephones, computers, vacuum cleaners and all the other
                    electrical stuff in your home. These are also called e-waste, e-scrap, or waste electrical and
                    electronic equipment (WEEE)<br><br>Some e-waste (like TV) contains lead, mercury, cadmium, and
                    brominated flame retardants. These are harmful to humans and the environment. It is therefore
                    important that the right authorities ensure the proper disposal of such waste.<br><br></p>

                <p style="color:black; width:80%; margin:auto;">When cars are all old and not working again, where do
                    they end up? Many people just leave them to rust in the fields, but there is a better way to deal
                    with them. In many cities, these vehicles are sent to the plant, where all the removable parts are
                    taken out for recycling. The rest is flattened up and shredded into peices for recycling. The last
                    bits that cannot be used again is sent to a landfill.<br><br></p>
