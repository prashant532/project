            <span class="byline" style="color:lightgrey;"><br>Waste are items we (individuals, offices, schools, industries, hospitals) don’t need and discard. Sometimes there are things we have that the law requires us to discard because they can be harmful. Waste comes in infinite sizes—some can be as small as an old toothbrush, or as large as the body of a school bus.</span><br><br><br><br>
            <span class="byline" style="color:lightgrey;">Waste has been a major environmental issue everywhere since the industrial revolution. Besides the waste we create at home, school and other public places, there are also those from hospitals, industries, farms and other sources. Humans rely so much on material things and they all (almost) end up as waste. And hey — where does the waste end up?</span><br><br><br>
            <span class="byline" style="color:lightgrey;">WEveryone creates waste, although some people are very environmentally conscious and create very little. Likewise, some countries do a very good job creating less waste and managing the rest. Others are pretty horrible and have created huge environmental problems for the people and animals living there.</span><br>

            <h2>Types of Waste</h2><br>
            <span class="byline"><br>Generally, waste could be liquid or solid waste. Both of them could be hazardous. Liquid and solid waste types can also be grouped into organic, re-usable and recyclable waste.
			Let us see some details below:</span><br><br>

        <div class="boxA">
            <h3><b><br><br>Liquid Waste<b></h3>
            <p><br>Waste can come in non-solid form. Some solid waste can also be converted to a liquid waste form for
                disposal. It includes point source and non-point source discharges such as storm water and wastewater.
                Examples of liquid waste include wash water from homes, liquids used for cleaning in industries and
                waste detergents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="boxB">
            <h3><b><br><br>Solid Waste<b></h3>
            <p><br>Solid waste predominantly, is any garbage, refuse or rubbish that we make in our homes and other
                places. These include old car tires, old newspapers, broken furniture and even food waste. They may
                include any waste that is non-liquid.<br><br></p>

        </div>
        <div class="boxC">
            <h3><b><br><br>Hazardous Waste<b></h3>
            <p><br>Hazardous or harmful waste are those that potentially threaten public health or the environment. Such
                waste could be inflammable , reactive , corrosive or toxic . In many countries, it is required by law to
                involve the appropriate authority to supervise the disposal of such hazardous waste.</p>

        <p><em>Europe creates about over 1.8 billion tonnes of waste each year. This means each person creates about
            3.5tonnes on average.<br></em></p>
        <p><em>In 2010, Americans generated about 250 million tons of trash and recycled and composted over 85 million
            tons of this material, equivalent to a 34.1 percent recycling rate (see Figure 1 and Figure 2). On average,
            we recycled and composted 1.51 pounds out of our individual waste generation of 4.43 pounds per person per
            day. —EPA, USA.<br></em></p>

        <p><b>What is the difference between trash and garbage?</b><br>
            <em>Solid waste form places like your atic, backyard or study. Trash items include paper and card boxes and
                the like.<br>
                This is waste from kitchen and bathroom. They also include waste from cooking food and from food storage
                facilities. <br></em></p>
